## 1.1.2

- Support main world content script to be bundled. Also added a guide and example for this.

## 1.1.1

- Add [a workaround](https://github.com/awesome-webextension/webpack-target-webextension/pull/42) for [a Chrome bug of loading content script in a sandboxed iframe](https://github.com/awesome-webextension/webpack-target-webextension/issues/41).
- Fix [compatibility with mini-css-extract-plugin in Manifest v3](https://github.com/awesome-webextension/webpack-target-webextension/issues/43)
- Add a warning if `background.pageEntry` and `background.serviceWorkerEntry` are the same.

  The only chunk loading method `serviceWorkerEntry` supports is  `importScripts` ([ES Module is not supported yet](https://github.com/awesome-webextension/webpack-target-webextension/issues/24)) and `pageEntry` only supports `<script>` or `import()`.

  The chunk loading methods they supported have no intersection, therefore this config is impossible to work. This will be a hard error in the next version.

## 1.1.0

- Deprecate `background.entry` and `background.manifest` in the config.
- Add `background.pageEntry` and `background.serviceWorkerEntry` in the config. Now you can build for both [limited event page](https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/issues/134) (used by [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Background_scripts) and Safari) and background service worker (Chrome) in a single webpack build.

### Migrations

If you have

- `background.manifest = 3`,
  1. remove `background.manifest`
  2. change `background.entry` to `background.serviceWorkerEntry`
- `background.manifest = 2` (or `undefined`),
  1. remove `background.manifest`
  2. change `background.entry` to `background.pageEntry`

## 1.0.5

Fix [frameId is missing when injecting content script (#36)](https://github.com/awesome-webextension/webpack-target-webextension/pull/36).

## 1.0.4

Fix [`__webpack_require__.e` is not a function in MV3 (#33)](https://github.com/awesome-webextension/webpack-target-webextension/issues/33).

## 1.0.3

Add `weakRuntimeCheck` option to support using with `mini-css-extract-plugin`.

## 1.0.2

Fix [false positive of `browser` when a dom id is browser (#28)](https://github.com/awesome-webextension/webpack-target-webextension/issues/28).

## 1.0.1

Fix chunk loading in MV3 background worker.

## 1.0.0

We made a big write to support Manifest V3.
